# Artificial Neural Network

The code in this repository contains the cycle for designing an artificial neural network to predict an index. Start by getting the data, identifying its mistakes or inconsistencies, building a single data table with all possible information on the study topic (in this case, I analyzed a sample of soccer game data), identifying the strategy to analyze all information through an artificial neural network and finally test the prediction results.
